1. the output shows all the of files in my directory. * matches any character in filenames except for a dot.
2. this output shows all the hidden files and directories in my current directory. This is probably because the . is used for hidden files and the * doesn't pick up on the . so you have to tell it to. 
3. you should never run these because they will delete all files in the current directory with no way of recovering them. 
4. I would sort the list by file modification time by using the comman ls -tr
5. I would use the command cat -n "insert filename"
6. The whatis command is used to search and display brief descriptions of Linux commands
7. file.txt contains the word apple
8. file.txt contains the word banana so > probably clears the text file and replaces it with the inputted word
9. file.txt contains the word banana and the word carrot on a new line, so >> probably adds the inputted word on a new line without clearing the file like > does.
10. the output is 1 7 14. the | operator take the output of the command on the left side and uses it as an input on the right side, which in this case is wc, which counts the lines, words, and characters.
